<img src="https://www.hauntedrooms.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Haunted-Island-of-the-Dolls-500x333.jpeg"/>

### Description

This a full stack app using Mongoose, Express, React, and Node. The app opens to a Home page which shows a list of countries, and you can click each country to view the most haunted places in that country. The user has an option to add a new place, or can delete or update a country.

### How to get started

- Fork and clone this repo
- `cd` into folder
- Open in broswer with `open.html`
- To make edits, open in VS code with `code .`

### Technologies Used:

- Country and Place schemas made with mongoose
- Express was used to create routes that connect the database to the front end
- React was used to create the front end of the app
- Functions were written in React components which then rendered on the page in React forms to use CRUD operations

#### Future Updates:

The desired future updates on this app include the ability to delete a specific places within a country, as well as update a specific place. Also, I would like to possibly add a drop down menu for creating a country.
